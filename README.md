<p id="description">Here I assume the role of a <b>Data Scientist</b> working for a startup name <b>SpaceY</b> intending to compete with SpaceX and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection data wrangling exploratory data analysis data visualization model development model evaluation and reporting results to stakeholders.

In this project we will predict if the <b>Falcon 9</b> first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of <b>$62 million</b>. Other providers cost upward of <b>$165 million</b> each much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</p>
